# A collection of functions/tools to do with Binary, Hexadecimal and Decimal 8-bit integers

# Here we import the 'randint' function from the 'random' library. Libraries are files that contain
# functions written by other people. In this case, writing a function that returns a random integer
# between two values could be hard and time consuming to code. In such a case, we can use somebody 
# else's code (the 'randint' function) to serve our purpose. Examples on when we might do this is 
# for generating random things and handling time.
