# pandr-matrix
This project aims to build an LED Matrix display-board for one of the classrooms at our school
## Aim:
- To give those who attend my Programming and Robotics Club a project to build together as part of a team
- I intend to do this by splitting up into smaller teams/groups that work on a specific part of the project, similar to how multiple people may work on a project in the workforce. This will give everyone a chance to contribute 
- My intention as Lead is to push the project in a direction where it will meet our criteria for being a successful product, making decisions and understanding the whole project myself. Capable students who attend the club may write a lot of code on their own, whereas those with less experience will benefit from my help
- Every student will be encouraged to work independently, but I will do my own research into everything that goes into building a project like this in an attempt to keep us on pace to have a product we are happy with before the end of the school year
